&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the upselling strategies of Alaska Airlines, we explore users&amp;rsquo; behaviors, motivations and overall experience of Alaska Airlines and its five competitors. Additionally, we study the impact of the current pandemic on their travel experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research identifies users&amp;rsquo; top values, pain points, and overarching themes that affect their decision to make additional purchases. We present our findings to multiple stakeholders and conclude with four recommendations that will improve the overall experience and lead to increase in sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The research findings matched with the ongoing research conducted by the company&amp;rsquo;s internal research team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our findings and key recommendations were presented to multiple internal stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- ![](./designquestion.svg) --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-question&#34;&gt;Design Question:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the motivations for upgrading throughout the booking and overall flight experience with Alaska and its competitors? Additionally, has the current pandemic affected this experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./journey.svg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./demographics.svg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-research&#34;&gt;User Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a total of 30 remote qualitative interviews (5 participants for 6 different airlines). We probed for X, Y, Z, and also had users interactively participate in the session through journey mapping in the Miro board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We divided the users journey map into 5 stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the initial booking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After booking but more than 24 hours from day of travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting to the airport and the process to onboarding the plane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arriving at the destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Navigating Cancer (NDA)</title>
      <link>https://jinjeon.me/project/navigating-cancer/</link>

&lt;p&gt;In summer 2020, I had a chance to work with the health tracker team at Navigating Cancer, a company that is devoted to enhancing the patient relationship management for cancer patients. During the weird time of COVID, the research team was working remotely as an international team with each of us in different time zones. I was also flying around being in the US and in my hometown Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-design-process&#34;&gt;The Design Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used design thinking framework to help us guide our research focus by better framing the problem and solving the users’ underlying needs.We adapted the double-diamond model, which maps the divergent and convergent stages of the design process. The model is divided into 4 phases (discover, define, develop, and deliver). We begin by exploring the users’ problem space through various research. Then we narrow down to defining the user needs. At the developing phase, we would build prototypes and deliver to the end users to test the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/pdf/navigating-cancer-resources/double-diamond.pdf&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ideal model is a perfectly-shaped two diamonds, the reality of our journey was rather a deformed diamond process. As we had to go back-and-forth within each phase, we had multiple pivots, which ended up being a valuable process as we gained greater insights to the problem space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tangible UI: Augmented Shadow Play</title>
      <link>https://jinjeon.me/project/shadowplay/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shadow casting possess different physical affordances that follow the laws of physics. Different shadow shapes and patterns can be created by manipulating the shadow’s light source direction and intensity, the physical object’s distance and angle, and the texture of the surface in which the shadow is casted. These physical properties can be used by the operator to create creative patterns with the projected shadows. Some of these physical affordances include playing with the shadow’s movement, superposing different object’s shadows and scaling the shadow’s size by moving the physical object closer or further from the light source. As aesthetically pleasing with its unique black and white contrast, shadows are a fascinating form of media that can create different textures and details based on the skill of the user.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/img/shadowplay/test.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt; Shadow Play aims to enhance such a playful shadow experience to more advanced creative form of art by allowing users digitally manipulate their shadows. By adding new digital affordances Shadow Play, users can print and add layers of multiple shadows onto the screen, and invigorate them with animated effects and motions. With such various mix of augmented shadow effects, users can utilize their body as a tool for creating their own unique shadow artwork and animations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/pdf/ShadowPlay.pdf&#34;&gt;See full paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input/Output:&lt;/strong&gt; Shadow Play requires ample activity space for interaction. The system recognizes the user within the activity space, and then displays the digitally augmented shadow onto the projected screen. Optimizing the interaction was one of our key concerns. With camera as an input device for users to communicate with Shadow Play, we wanted to depict the metaphor of users &lt;em&gt;taking pictures&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;filming&lt;/em&gt; the creation. By selecting different features, such as snapshot, mirror, effects, and loop, users can create unique patterns and artwork. &lt;img src=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/img/shadowplay/setup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Setting the environment:&lt;/strong&gt; With the shoot feature, users can add layers of current shadows to the previous ones. Users can create static shadows, in which we refer to as background/environment of the artwork. &lt;img src=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/img/shadowplay/env.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Adding in motion and effects:&lt;/strong&gt; After the environment has been set, users can enliven the shadow by adding in animated motions and effects. The loop feature, mainly inspired by Instagram, records the motion of shadows and then is automatically looped. By adding in the fireball effect, Shadow Play recognizes the hand motion of reaching out, which then shoots out a fireball from the tip of the hand. &lt;img src=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/img/shadowplay/motion.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Advanced: Mirror and Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; The mirror feature allows users to create symmetrical images and animation. The mirror feature is especially useful for creating patterns and symmetrical image, such as butterfly. &lt;img src=&#34;https://jinjeon.me/img/shadowplay/mirror.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the mix of these features, users can create shadow artwork in playful environment. Shadow Play resembles the thought process and planning of an actual painting. Just as an artist would plan ahead where certain objects would be placed within the space before making the strokes, Shadow Play users have to deliberately organize the angle and distance of their body in order to perfect the layers of shadow into a single object shape. Such deliberation allows for more playful and interactive activity. By having the augmented shadows displayed on the screen, there is a loop of feedback and manipulation as users constantly refer to the captured shadow to make adjustments accordingly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

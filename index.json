I use the experiment data to display basic statistical tests in Python.\nResearch Question:  Is there a difference in providing personal information between USA and Korean Internet users within two different use scenarios: online banking and shopping?\n I use the following tests:\n Pearson Correlation Coefficient T-Test Mann-Whitney Test One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Two-Way ANOVA\nimport os import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import scipy from matplotlib import pyplot import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from statsmodels.formula.api import ols import statsmodels.formula.api as smf import statsmodels.api as sm from statsmodels.stats.anova import AnovaRM import pdb # for debugging import warnings warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning) # set color sns.set_color_codes('pastel')   Setup \u0026amp; Querying Data It is first critical to understand the dataframe to play around and make analysis. Usually, long-format data is desired (or at least I\u0026rsquo;m used to it) for using Python and Seaborn for data visualization. Long format is basically when each variable is represented as a column, and each observation or event is a row. Below, we read in, and query the data.\nUseful commands:  df.head(): by default, shows first five rows of df df.columns(): prints all the columns in df df.describe(): provides summary description of df pd.read_csv(data, usecols=['col1', 'col2', ...,]): can be used to filter columns\n# read in data.csv file as df \u0026amp; see data structure df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # query data by scenario and culture bank = df.query(\u0026quot;scenario == 'Bank'\u0026quot;).copy() shop = df.query(\u0026quot;scenario == 'Shop'\u0026quot;).copy() kor = df.query(\u0026quot;culture == 'Korea'\u0026quot;).copy() usa = df.query(\u0026quot;culture == 'USA'\u0026quot;).copy()  # an example of the data structure usa.head()    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    UserGuid culture scenario interface complete first last phone dob sex ... address citizenship website password username relationship reason total total_possible percent     0 0 USA Bank A - 1 1 1 2 0 ... 3 0 0 3 1 0 - 14 27 0.518519   1 0 USA Shop A - 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 3 1 0 - 5 24 0.208333   2 0 USA Bank B - 1 1 1 2 0 ... 3 0 0 3 1 0 - 14 27 0.518519   3 0 USA Shop B - 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 3 1 0 - 5 24 0.208333   4 1 USA Bank A - 1 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 - 1 27 0.037037    5 rows × 24 columns\n 1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient When we want to ask \u0026ldquo;how strongly correlated are the two variables?\u0026rdquo;, we can use Perason\u0026rsquo;s Correlation. It is used to measure statistical relationship or association between two continuous variables that are linearly related to each other. The coefficient value \u0026ldquo;r\u0026rdquo; ranges from -1 (negative relation) to 1 (perfectly positive). 0 would mean that there is no relationship at all.\nProperties of Pearson Correlation  The units of the values do not affect the Pearson Correlation.  i.e. Changing the unit of value from cm to inches do not affect the r value  The correlation between the two variables is symmetric:  i.e. A -\u0026gt; B is equal to B -\u0026gt; A   ** Use Spearman\u0026rsquo;s Correlation when the two variables have non-linear relationship (e.g. a curve instead of a straight line).\nCode Implementation We use scipy package to calculate the Pearson Correlation. The method will return two values: r and p value.\n# let's look at the correlation of information provided by different scenarios: online banking vs. shopping # bank['percent'] will return an array of percentage values r, p = scipy.stats.pearsonr(bank['percent'], shop['percent']) print('r: ' + str(r.round(4))) print('p: ' + str(p.round(4)))  r: 0.7592 p: 0.0  From the results above, we can see there is a strong positive relationship between the amount of information provided in banking and shopping. i.e. Providing information in banking would affect how a user provides personal information in shopping.\n2. T-Test When comparing the means of two groups, we can use a t-test. It takes into account of the means and the spread of the data to determine whether a difference between the two would occur by chance or not (determined by the p-value being less than 0.05 usually). In a t-test, there should be only two independent variables (categorical/nominal variables) and one dependent continuous variable.\nProperties of t-test  The data is assumed to be normal (If the distribution is skewed, use Mann-Whitney test).  T-test yields t and p value:\n2a. The higher the t, the more difference there is between the two groups. The lower the t, the more similar the two groups are.\n2b. T-value of 2 means the groups are twice as different from each other than they are within each other\n2c. The lower the p-value, the better (meaning that it is significant and the difference did not occure by chance). P-value of 0.05 means that there is 5 percent happening by chance\n  Code Implementation We use scipy package again to run a t-test. Before we decide which test to run, we can quickly plot and see the distribution like below.\nsns.distplot(df[df['scenario'] == 'Bank'].percent)  \u0026lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1c238f61d0\u0026gt;  The distribution looks relatively normal. We can run a t-test to see whether there is a difference between the total amount of information provided by the users from each use scenario: i.e. banking vs. shopping\n# we run a t-test to see whether there ia a difference in the amount of information provided in each scenario t, p = scipy.stats.ttest_ind(df[df['scenario'] == 'Bank'].percent, df[df['scenario'] == 'Shop'].percent) print('t: ' + str(t.round(4))) print('p: ' + str(p.round(6)))  t: 4.8203 p: 2e-06  The result above shows that there is a significant difference in the amount of information provided between two use scenarios with t-value being high, and p-value being very small. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t actually know which scenario yields more information than the other. The t-test only tells there is a significant difference.\nTo find out, we can create a little fancy distribution plot with some box plots:\nbanking = df[df['scenario'] == 'Bank'].percent shopping = df[df['scenario'] == 'Shop'].percent # let's plot box-dist plot combined f, (ax_box1, ax_box2, ax_dist) = plt.subplots(3, sharex=True, gridspec_kw= {\u0026quot;height_ratios\u0026quot;: (0.3, 0.3, 1)}) # add boxplots at the top sns.boxplot(banking, ax=ax_box1, color='g') sns.boxplot(shopping, ax=ax_box2, color='m') ax_box1.axvline(np.mean(banking), color='g', linestyle='--') ax_box2.axvline(np.mean(shopping), color='m', linestyle='--') plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.87) plt.suptitle('Amount of information provided by use scenario', fontsize = 17) # add distplots below sns.distplot(banking, ax=ax_dist, label='Banking', kde=True, rug=True, color='g', norm_hist=True, bins=2) sns.distplot(shopping, ax=ax_dist, label='Shopping', kde=True, rug=True, color='m', norm_hist=True, bins=2) ax_dist.axvline(np.mean(banking), color='g', linestyle='--') ax_dist.axvline(np.mean(shopping), color='m', linestyle='--') plt.legend() plt.xlabel('Percentage of information', fontsize=16) ax_box1.set(xlabel='') ax_box2.set(xlabel='')  [Text(0.5, 0, '')]  From the graph above, we see that the mean of the banking is greater than the mean of shopping. This shows us that regardless of cultural background, users are more likely to provide personal information in the banking scenario.\n3. Mann-Whitney Test The Mann-Whitney Test allows you to determine if the observed difference is statistically significant without making the assumption that the values are normally distributed. You should have two independent variables and one continuous dependent variable.\nCode Implementation We can run the test on the same banking vs. shopping scenario.\nt, p = scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu(df[df['scenario'] == 'Bank'].percent, df[df['scenario'] == 'Shop'].percent) print('t: ' + str(t.round(4))) print('p: ' + str(p.round(6)))  t: 14795.5 p: 4.1e-05  4. One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ANOVA is similar to a t-test, but it is used when there are three or more independent variables (categorical). It assumes normal distribution (use Kruskal-Wallis if abnormal?). One-way ANOVA compares the means between the variables to test whether the difference is statistically significant. However, it does not tell you which specific groups were statistically different from one another. Thus, a post-hoc analysis is required.\nCode Implementation The result below suggests that there is a statistical difference in the means of the three variables.\n# we can create a third variable, and compare the var1, var2, and var3 with one-way ANOVA var3 = df[df['culture'] == 'USA'].percent scipy.stats.f_oneway(banking, shopping, var3)  F_onewayResult(statistic=11.171874914065159, pvalue=1.7072783704546878e-05)  5. Two-Way ANOVA A two-way ANOVA can be used when you want to know how two independent variables have an interaction effect on a dependent variable. CAVEAT: a two-way ANOVA does not tell which variable is dominant.\nCode Implementation Below in the code, we see if there is an interaction effect between culture and scenario use cases on the total amount of information provided. For example, would Americans be more willing to provide personal information than Koreans? If so, does the use case (either banking vs. shopping) affect at all?\n# we give in a string value of each variable, and the interaction variable 'culture:scenario' model = ols('percent ~ culture + scenario + culture:scenario', data=df).fit() sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    sum_sq df F PR(\u0026gt;F)     culture 0.000344 1.0 0.007439 0.931312   scenario 1.070130 1.0 23.159298 0.000002   culture:scenario 0.032834 1.0 0.710576 0.399772   Residual 17.928461 388.0 NaN NaN     Conclusion From the table above, only scenario has a sole effect on the total amount of information provided (depicted as percent in the dataframe). We see culture, and the interaction of culture and scenario do not have an effect on the amount of information that users provided.\nThe finding matches with the previous t-test and graph results, where users provided more information in the banking than they would in shopping.\n","date":1616371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616371200,"objectID":"8b986d43b9eb58d086b72ee549497f58","permalink":"https://jinjeon.me/post/quant-ux/","publishdate":"2021-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/quant-ux/","section":"post","summary":"Example codes used for running basic t-test to one-way and two-way ANOVA","tags":["python","data"],"title":"Quantitative Data Analysis with Statistical Testing","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1607558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607558400,"objectID":"0852b0de634f6d6c641c401c5818cdba","permalink":"https://jinjeon.me/project/coffitok/","publishdate":"2020-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/coffitok/","section":"project","summary":"From identifying user needs to iterating prototypes, a 10-week project in user centered design **(opens external project link)**","tags":["research","side-projects"],"title":"Coffitok","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  .introduction { column-count: 2; }  My Role: UX researcher in a 4-person team of researchers and designers\nMethods: generative research, competitive analysis, remote qualitative interview, journey map, affinity diagram\nTimeline:  June 2020 - Oct 2020 (~4 months)\nStakeholders: Research manager, product designers, brand manager, eCommerce team \nOverview To help Alaska Airlines flexibly adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and improve its upsell strategies, the team conducted user research to understand users\u0026rsquo; behaviors, values, and motivations at different stages of their flight travel experiences. We studied Alaska Airlines and five other major airlines operating in the US to conduct competitive analysis and pair insights from user experience benchmarking.\nImpact  Presented four major recommendations to research managers, product and eCommerce teams. Research findings matched with the ongoing internal research, suggesting its validity. Provided recommendations on how the company in the travel industry can adapt to the pandemic.  Research Question  \u0026ldquo;What are the motivations for upgrading throughout the booking and overall flight experience with Alaska and its competitors? Additionally, has the current pandemic affected this experience?\u0026rdquo;\n Project Timeline    Our project spanned from late June to October. We initiated our study with reviewing company\u0026rsquo;s past research, examining the different competitors and case studies. We then proceeded with running qualitative interviews on UserTesting.com to get to the hearty meat of this research   User Research Please note that below are summarized insights and challenges our team had during the user research process.\nPreliminary \u0026amp; Competitive Analysis Goal:\nTo first better understand the competitive landscape of the airline industries, we examined the websites of the six airlines to visualize the user flow of booking a flight.\n💡 Key/fun Fact:\nDespite the industry standard of generalizing the classification of seat types into economy, business, and first class, we noticed that each airline had different ways of classifying, naming, and promoting the different fare classes. We searched for areas that could be confusing and be improved for the users.\n   Each airline had its own ways of classifying and naming the seats. Even though the perks that came along with each fare type were quite consistent throughout, low-cost airline, such as Southwest, had a uniquely different seating plan.   Insights:  Alaska Airlines\u0026rsquo; fare types were straightforward and transparent. The seat names are in consistent ascending order: i.e. saver → economy → premium → first class. Fare types and their associated perks can become very unclear:\ne.g. JetBlue\u0026rsquo;s first class name is \u0026ldquo;Mint\u0026rdquo; which has no association with Blue.\ne.g. SouthWest\u0026rsquo;s distinction between basic economy and economy is vague. United had the most visually busy interface and complex fare types, leading to a poor booking experience.  Qualitative Interview Goal:\nTo understand users\u0026rsquo;:  General flight behavior Top values\n Pain points\n \nMethods:\n Remote Qualitative Interview: \nWe conducted a total of 30 interviews (5 participants from 6 different airlines) remotely over UserTesting.com and Zoom. We probed for their general flying behaviors and preferences, and narrowed down to their most recent flight experience (considering both pre-COVID \u0026amp; post-COVID).    We accounted for various factors, including age, gender, income range, and travel behaviors, during our interview to capture the holistic view of participants\u0026rsquo; travel experiences.   Interactive Journey Maps:\nWe incorporated an interactive journey map session in each interview to have participants walkthrough their most recent experience and capture their moment-to-moment emotions and actions.\nTo capture their moment-to-moment emotions and actions, we divided the entire flight experience into 5 phases:  booking the flight ticket (e.g. web vs. mobile vs. phone) before 24 hours of travel (includes preparation and traveling to the airport) being at the airport (checking-in, luggage, security checks, and so on) in-flight (seat space, perks, food \u0026amp; beverage, etc) arrival (post travel experience)    A simplified abstract example of the interactive journey map: Participants can vertically toggle each action item (as shown in the red arrows) based on their overall experience of that particular event (Good to Poor).   \nThematic Analysis    We explored multi-facets of the travel experience to search for emerging themes from the qualitative data we collected from interviews and journey maps.      Overview of our affinity map. We inductively searched for overarching themes by\u0026hellip;\nParticipant journey map → airline journey map → all airline journey map. From each participant\u0026rsquo;s journey map, we combined them to characterize the overall experience of each airline. We then combined all airlines to identify any patterns.   Key Insights \u0026amp; Results Please note that below are filtered results due to NDA.\nPersonas/Highlights Three prototypical personas were developed. The information provides basic demographic information, a hypothetical trip destination, quote from the interview, means used to book and upgrade the seat. It also identifies top values, pain points, and motivations for upgrading a seat. Only 1 of the 3 is shown here.   This first type of personas is characterized by how upgrading a seat is mandatory due to his large body size. With his tall height and broad shoulders, upgrading a seat is a necessity.   --\n   The second person is characterized by how traveling in the pandemic era is worst not just because of the safety concerns, but also due to the lack of services. Another unique perspective is the consideration for how family members can buy tickets for other family members.     This person is characterized as a bargain hunter, constantly looking for deals and offers. The person is unique in that he is tech savvy and even conscious about which aircraft type he would be flying in.   -- Characterizing the Travel Experience    An overall experience of Airline X: We visualized a typical journey map, capturing the different motivations for upgrading a seat at each stage of travel. We identified values, emotions, and quotes.   We then devised step-by-step recommendations for each travel stage (NDA).\nRecommendations Please note this part is NDA sensitive. Based on key insights and results we synthesized from the data, we came up with four major recommendations.    The four high level recommendations   💡 Key Fact:\n TRANSPARENCY MATTERS: it is a critical factor in the overall experience especially due to COVID. Users desire clear communication on what services and ancillaries to expect when flying during this pandemic era.\n Quantitative metrics, such as time to complete a booking, are less important than transparency. Transparency translates to expectations. When expectations are not met, the overall experience worsens. Clear communication on what each seat upgrade entails can entice users. e.g. \u0026ldquo;upgrading a seat will get you a 7-inch wider leg room\u0026rdquo;. **Users don't mind receiving few more notifications** for clarifying and communicating the travel information (especially if contains deals).  --   Design Recommendations Based on the four recommendations, we additionally modified some of the website elements to convey more transparency.\n1. Show what services are suspended    Click to see in large view/ We added a devoted section that clearly communicates what services are currently suspended especially due to COVID (e.g. in-flight food \u0026amp; beverages). When a user is expecting quality in-flight service but does not receive it, the experience cannot be reverted   2. Clearly communicate the perks of upgrading    Click to see in large view/ Communicating what an upgraded seat entails provide transparency and facilitates the upgrading decision.   Limitations \u0026amp; Lessons Learned  The participants were not racially diverse as recruitment of participants were automatically done via UserTesting.com.\n Majority of participants\u0026rsquo; recent travels occurred 6 months ago, in which they may have distorted memory of their travel experiences.\n In a qualitative research, it\u0026rsquo;s more about finding about the big buckets \u0026amp; themes unlike a quant research. When presenting the different demographic groups, it can be as easy as describing \u0026ldquo;we examined a wide income group\u0026rdquo; instead of graphing out all the different income groups. If all the demographic information was graphically presented, it can convey the different stakeholders, esp. data scientists, that the results and insights will be quant focused when the research is actually qualitative.\n     With that, I end with a fun quote from one of our participants 😄   Back to top ^ \n","date":1601856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601856000,"objectID":"c24341871115386f21f688709c1cda00","permalink":"https://jinjeon.me/project/alaska-airlines/","publishdate":"2020-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/alaska-airlines/","section":"project","summary":"Moderated interviews and journey mapping to visualize users' travel experiences","tags":["highlights","research"],"title":"Alaska Airlines (Company sponsored summer project/NDA)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  .introduction { column-count: 2; }  My Role: UX researcher in a 4-person team of researchers and designers\nMethods: survey, interview, affinity diagram, prototyping, heuristic evaluation, usability testing\nTimeline:  Jul 2020 - Sep 2020 (~3 months)\nStakeholders: product manager, senior designer, clinicians, patients \nOverview To improve patients\u0026rsquo; experiences with symptom management and engagement with the health tracker, the team conducted user research to identify needs, concept-tested prototypes, and delivered a high-fidelity prototype to the leaders and multiple stakeholders. + With COVID-19, the team was working remotely as an international, cross-functional team with each of us in different time zones. I was also flying around being in the US and my hometown Korea, making the project more dynamic!\nImpact  Presented research findings and 4 major feature recommendations to leaders and multiple stakeholders. Received strong positive feedbacks from the stakeholders, and recommendations aligned with company\u0026rsquo;s future milestones.  Research Question  \u0026ldquo;How might we increase patient engagement with health tracker?\u0026rdquo;\n The Design Process Unfolding the Research through Design Framework Part of our team\u0026rsquo;s mission was to evangelize the impact of research as the company lacked a dedicated research team. We incorporated the Double Diamond design framework to help us guide our research focus by better framing the problem and solving the users\u0026rsquo; underlying needs.\nThis case study will unfold along with the different stages of the Double Diamond.\nThe Ideal Double Diamond    The ideal double diamond. Design frameworks help organize the design thinking process by helping researchers better frame the problem and focus on identifying and solving the users’ underlying needs.\nThe model, divided into 4 phases (discover, define, develop, and deliver), maps the divergent and convergent stages of the design process.   but the Reality\u0026hellip;    The deformed double diamond. While the ideal model is a perfectly-shaped two diamonds, the reality of our research journey was a deformed diamond process. We made multiple pivots along the research, which ended up being a valuable process as we gained greater insights to the problem space.   User Research Please note that below are summarized insights our team had during the user research process.\n   Click to see in large view Overall high-level research process. We began our research with a general survey. From the insights from the general survey and existing survey results from the company, we conducted interviews with cancer patients and survivors.   Discover  We initiated our research with a general survey sent out online (n=72) to understand the general space of health care and health trackers. It helped us identify people\u0026rsquo;s health goals and tracking habits. From the general survey results, we devised a remote moderated interview plan to better understand what it feels like to undergo cancer treatments and how they manage their symptoms. From the interview with cancer patients and survivors, affinity mapping helped us categorize their responses into various sections, such as their emotions throughout the oncology journey, how they track and manage their symptoms, interaction with the care team and caregivers, and so on.  Key Insights Interview with the patients and survivors shed light to clearly understand not just how they manage their symptoms, but empathize with their adjusted lifestyles and daily challenges.\n Through quantitative analysis of the self-reported metrics, I identified that \u0026ldquo;older people\u0026rsquo;s self perception of health level is higher than that of younger people\u0026rdquo; Cancer oncology treatments were perceived as long \u0026ldquo;journeys\u0026rdquo; even sometimes with no end. Symptom management varies by each individual, severity, and cancer types. As a researcher and designer, another design challenge was how we can deliver a solution that addresses all cancer types and patients.     Click to see large view.    Define Below are only partial insights synthesized.\n💡 Key Insight:\n Identifying the user needs and listing out the stories in a prioritized order immensely helped the team properly guide to the next steps.\n We synthesized potential features that would address the user needs.\n     User Stories. These are partial high-level user stories synthesized from the research.    Develop  💡 Key Insights:\n With my background in data visualization, I was particularly fascinated in developing visual dashboards and data visualization to help patients track their symptoms.\n One key lesson I learned was: Designing should always consider the target audience first.\n Excited to develop data visualization screens, I initially thought that the more diverse, interactive, and comprehensive graphs are, the better. Nevertheless, during the expert evaluation and concept-testing, I realized that the screens were simply too busy and users (particularly the old population that are less tech savvy) find the visuals to be too complicated and less informative.      Click to see in large view. Developing prototypes. We began our development with quick sketches using Google\u0026rsquo;s Crazy 8\u0026rsquo;s methodology. We used Figma to develop into a high-fidelity prototypes, which were later concept-tested in the deliver phase    Concept-testing    We conducted concept-testing with 8 users, and organized by each participant. We then categorized by themes and features.       Concept-testing helped us narrow down our scope, and focus on key 3 areas, and specifically 4 feature design recommendations.    Deliver (Design Recommendations) ** Disclaimer: Below displays only 2 of the total 4 final design recommendations **\nIn order to ensure that our design solutions stem to delivering the actual user needs, we explicitly stated the user needs that are being met with each design recommendation.\n1. Dashboard and Data Visualization Personalized dashboard provides a way to effectively track users\u0026rsquo; past symptoms and even compare and predict how they would feel in the next few days.          2. Journal Journal feature lets users record their symptoms through various means.

Amount of information in an event (N of possible outcomes, or grey value in images)\n The larger the number of possible outcomes, the larger the information gain  Ex. Information gain from a sentence would exponentially increase with length of sentence\n If outcome is 1, information gain is 0 (i.e. log1 = 0)   2. Uncertainty of outcome in an event\n Amount of information gain with probability is inversely related to the probability that the event will take place. The information per event is weighted by the probability of the event The rarer an event, the more significance the event has When all events are likely to occur, uncertainty or entropy is maximum (ie. more possible outcomes) Most common entropy form is the Shannon\u0026rsquo;s entropy: \\begin{equation} H = \\sum_{i} p_i log(p_i) \\end{equation}   Entropy Example \u0026gt; In a fair coin toss, entropy is maximum. Vice versa, the more unfair the coint toss is, the more definitive the outcome is (which means lower entropy)\n\u0026gt; Fair coin toss: P(head) = 0.5, P(tail) = 0.5\n\u0026gt; Entropy = -0.5log0.5 - 0.5log0.5 = 0.150 + 0.150 = 0.300 \u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Unfair coin toss: P(head) = 0.8, P(tail) = 0.2\n\u0026gt; Entropy = -0.8log0.8 - 0.2log0.2 = 0.077 + 0.140 = 0.217\n 3. Dispersion of probability distribution\n Shannon\u0026rsquo;s entropy can be used as a measure of dispersion of a probability distribution. It can be computed on images by looking at their dispersion of grey values Image with single intensity will have low entropy value as it contains little information. Conversely, if image with varying intesity will have higher entropy value with more information Ex. image with single sharp peak (ie. grey value condensed in small area) will have low entropy value  Mutual Information The goal of registration is to maximize mutual information or the overlaps. There are three ways of interpreting MI, in which they are identical but in different forms of expression and relation of variables.\n I(X, Y) = H(Y) - H(Y | X)\n This is the most closest form of mutual information. ie. MI of X and Y is subtracting entropy of H(Y) from the conditional entropy H(Y|X) (or p(Y) given p(X): chance of grey value in B given that corresponding image in A has grey value).\n In expression of uncertainty, MI is the amount by which uncertainty about Y changes when the amount of X containing Y is given   I(X, Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X, Y)\n It is the most closest form to joint entropy. H(X | Y) tells us that mutual information is greater when the joint entropy is lower. Small entropy or less dispersion would mean that information overlaps more.\n  I(X, Y) = Sum of [p(x,y) log (p(x,y) / p(x)p(y))]\n This formula is analogous to Kullback-Leibler distance, which measures the distance between two distributions. It measures the dependence of the two images by calculating the distance between the joint distribution of the image\u0026rsquo;s grey values p(x,y) and the joint distribution in case of independence of the two images p(x)p(y) We will use this formula to measure MI later in the code   Code Implementation Now let\u0026rsquo;s try using Python to measure mutual information of given images. We will be mainly comparing in two ways: comparing the identical images, and two different images.\n1. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with a setup, and direct the image files from __future__ import division import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import os import nibabel as nib # set gray colormap and nearest neighbor interpolation by default plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'gray' plt.rcParams['image.interpolation'] = 'nearest' # set the images os.chdir('/Users/Jin/Documents/MATLAB') img1 = '4_23_Drake.nii' img2 = '4_24_Denzel_Washington.nii'  2. Let\u0026rsquo;s slice the image and set side by side to display def get_img_slice(img, size=50): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; load the image using nibabel and slice the image by given size Parameters ---------- img: nii image data read via nibabel Returns ------- numpy memmap: ndarray of image slice \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; img_data = nib.load(img) img_data = img_data.get_data() img_slice = img_data[:, :, size] # 50 is arbitrary here # convert any nans to 0s img_nans = np.isnan(img_slice) img_slice[img_nans] = 0 return img_slice img1_slice = get_img_slice(img1) img2_slice = get_img_slice(img2)  # display images left and right def plot_raw(img1, img2): plt.imshow(np.hstack((img1, img2))) plt.show() plot_raw(img1_slice, img1_slice)  3. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot a 1d histogram for each of the two iamges def plot_hist1d(img1, img2, bins=20): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; one dimensional histogram of the slices Parameters ---------- img1: nii image data read via nibabel img2: nii image data read via nibabel bins: optional (default=20) bin size of the histogram Returns ------- histogram comparing two images side by side \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2) axes[0].hist(img1.ravel(), bins) axes[0].set_title('Img1 histogram') axes[1].hist(img2.ravel(), bins) axes[1].set_title('Img2 histogram') plt.show()  plot_hist1d(img1_slice, img2_slice)  4. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the two images against each other on a scatter plot, and calculate correlation coefficient def plot_scatter2d(img1, img2): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; plot the two image's histogram against each other Parameters ---------- img1: nii image data read via nibabel img2: nii image data read via nibabel Returns ------- 2d plotting of the two images and correlation coeeficient \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; corr = np.corrcoef(img1.ravel(), img2.ravel())[0, 1] plt.plot(img1.ravel(), img2.ravel(), '.') plt.xlabel('Img1 signal') plt.ylabel('Img2 signal') plt.title('Img1 vs Img2 signal cc=' + str(corr)) plt.show()  # this one is comparing two identical images so it should equal 1 plot_scatter2d(img1_slice, img1_slice) # image 1 vs image 2 plot_scatter2d(img1_slice, img2_slice)  Feature Space Using MI as a registration measure, we plot a feature space (or joint histogram), a two-dimensional plot showing the combinations of grey values in each of the two images for all corresponding points. For example, for each corresponding point (x, y), in which x and y are coordinates of first and second images respectively,\nAs the alignment of the two images change, the feature space changes. The more correctly registered the two images are, the more anatomical structures will overlap, showing clusters for the grey values. When the images are misaligned, the intensity of the clusters for certain structures will decrease, and a new pair of (x, y) will be matched as the image gets incorrectly aligned with other nearby structures of the other image. This is be shown as the dispersion of the clustering.\n5. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot a joint histogram now def plot_joint_histogram(img1, img2, bins=20, log=True): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; plot feature space. Given two images, the feature space is constructed by counting the number of times a combination of grey values occur Parameters ---------- img1: nii image data read via nibabel img2: nii image data read via nibabel bins: optional (default=20) bin size of the histogram log: boolean (default=True) keeping it true will show a better contrasted image Returns ------- joint histogram feature space of the two images in graph \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; hist_2d, x_edges, y_edges = np.histogram2d(img1.ravel(), img2.ravel(), bins) # transpose to put the T1 bins on the horizontal axis and use 'lower' to put 0, 0 at the bottom of the plot if not log: plt.imshow(hist_2d.T, origin='lower') plt.xlabel('Img1 signal bin') plt.ylabel('Img2 signal bin') # log the values to reduce the bins with large values hist_2d_log = np.zeros(hist_2d.shape) non_zeros = hist_2d != 0 hist_2d_log[non_zeros] = np.log(hist_2d[non_zeros]) plt.imshow(hist_2d_log.T, origin='lower') plt.xlabel('Img1 signal bin') plt.ylabel('Img2 signal bin')  # this should print a linear graph as it's comparing it to itself print(plot_joint_histogram(img1_slice, img1_slice))  None  # compare images 1 and 2 print(plot_joint_histogram(img1_slice, img2_slice))  None  6. Let\u0026rsquo;s calculate the mutual information of the two images now. We use the third formula stated above to measure the overlaps of the two images. The goal of registration is to maximize mutual information or the overlaps.\ndef mutual_information(img1, img2, bins=20): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; measure the mutual information of the given two images Parameters ---------- img1: nii image data read via nibabel img2: nii image data read via nibabel bins: optional (default=20) bin size of the histogram Returns ------- calculated mutual information: float \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; hist_2d, x_edges, y_edges = np.histogram2d(img1.ravel(), img2.ravel(), bins) # convert bins counts to probability values pxy = hist_2d / float(np.sum(hist_2d)) px = np.sum(pxy, axis=1) # marginal x over y py = np.sum(pxy, axis=0) # marginal y over x px_py = px[:, None] * py[None, :] # broadcast to multiply marginals # now we can do the calculation using the pxy, px_py 2D arrays nonzeros = pxy \u0026gt; 0 # filer out the zero values return np.sum(pxy[nonzeros] * np.log(pxy[nonzeros] / px_py[nonzeros]))  # the MI value of the first should be greater than the second as the first is comparing the image to itself print(mutual_information(img1_slice, img1_slice)) print(mutual_information(img1_slice, img2_slice))  1.1967155090861803 0.20578049748917815  Calculating the Grand Average of Mutual Information The codes above are detailed step-by-step processes. We can condense the codes above into one useful function that will allow us to examine the overall average of mutual information of each every scan image to the register image.\nFor example, given a register type (\u0026lsquo;rtf\u0026rsquo; for register to first image, or \u0026lsquo;rtm\u0026rsquo; for register to mean), it will calculate each scan to the register image, calculate the MI, and return the grand average MI value.\nNote: The code is currently based on ACCRE system so the paths directing to the images must be changed for flexible use. The path should direct to the folder which holds all the scan images, and since it requires gigabytes of data, I had to implement the code on ACCRE-use only.\ndef get_avg_mi(subjID, type='rtf', saveText=False, verbose=False, nScans=187): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; calculates the correlation coefficient and mutual information of the registered image to the rest of image files, and returns the grand average and trial averages Parameters ---------- subjID : str string of subject data (ie.

Then we will run a t-test on the two averages and plot the differences for visual reference.

However, the more the words are given as input, the more likely each word meaning gets diluted.\nThis notebook is based on the Semantic Similarity with TF-Hub Universal Encoder tutorial, but uses a separate input from one of the projects. We will also use GloVe vectors to compare how the vectors and cosine similarity differ between the two models.\n First, the notebook goes over setting up locally and use one sample data to create embeddings saved out as a separate csv file using Pandas.\n Then assuming you have cloned the repository, we call in custom functions to quickly extract vectors of given word, phrase, sentences in USE and GloVe.\n  Table of Contents/Short-cuts:  About USE Models and Deep Average Network Installation \u0026amp; Setup Path Setup Raw Data Format Get USE Embeddings Cosine Similarity Cosine Similarity Examples Plotting Similarity Matrix  About USE Models and Deep Average Network There are two types of models in USE: Transformer and Deep Averaging Network (DAN). We will use DAN which is a lighter version for efficiency and speed in exchange for reduced accuracy (still accurate enough).\nDAN first averages the input word embeddings to create a sentence embedding. It uses PTB tokenizer, which divides a sentence into a sequence of tokens based on set of rules on how to process punctuation, articles, etc, in order to create 512 dimension embeddings. This averaged 512 vector is passed to one or more feedforward layers. Then it is multi-task-trained on unsupervised data drawn from various internet sources, Wikipedia, Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus, web news, and forums. - Training goals: - Uses skip-thought-like model that predicts the surrounding sentences of a given text (see below) - Conversational response suggestion - Classification task on supervised data\nThe intuition behind deep feedforward neural network is that each layer learns a more abstract representation of the input than the previous one. So its depth allows to capture subtle variations of the input with more depths.

You can check via pip freeze\n tested on python == 3.6.8 | tensorflow == 1.15.0 | tensorflow_hub == 0.7.0  Or you can check the version in Python via:\nimport sys print(sys.version_info) # sys.version_info(major=3, minor=6, micro=8, releaselevel='final') print(tf.__version__) # '1.15.0' print(hub.__version__) # '0.7.0'  # script variables # for lite/DAN version: module_url = \u0026quot;https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2\u0026quot; # for heavy/Transformer version: # module_url = \u0026quot;https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/3\u0026quot; baseDir = 'use-glove-narrative' # repository/base folder name embedding_size = 512 # base 512-dimension embedding  Path Setup Assuming that you git cloned the project (which is for demo purposes) to your local directory, we set the path so the code knows where to look for certain data files using the baseDir specified above. We will mainly just work within the cloned folder.\npwd = os.getcwd() # recursively find absolute path while os.path.basename(pwd) != baseDir: os.chdir('..') pwd = os.getcwd() baseDir = pwd dataDir = baseDir + '/data' # recursively find all csv files.

Here, we are only interested in the \u0026lsquo;text\u0026rsquo; column and \u0026lsquo;index\u0026rsquo; column. We will call in the text of the entire story to create embeddings for each idea unit.

We then use these vectors to explore semantic similarity between text and phrases.\n# run the code below to save out as csv file vector_df.reindex(columns=vector_df_columns) vector_df.to_csv(title + '_vectors.csv', index=False)  Cosine Similarity As a brief description, cosine similarity is basically the measure of cosine angle between the two vectors. Since we have USE and GloVe vectors that represent words into multidimensional vectors, we can apply these vector values to calculate how similar the two words are.\nIt can be easily calculated in Python with its useful packages:\ncos_sim = numpy.dot(vector1, vector2)/(numpy.linalg.norm(vector1) * numpy.linalg.norm(vector2))  Assuming we established some basic understanding, let\u0026rsquo;s call in the functions I made so that we can easily get USE and GloVe vectors at multiple word level.\nI will highlight some of the functions below:\nfrom get_glove_use import * help(glove_vec) help(use_vec)  Help on function glove_vec in module get_glove_use: glove_vec(item1, item2) get vectors for given two words and calculate cosine similarity Parameters ---------- item1 : str string in glove word pool vector to compare item2 : str string in glove word pool vector to compare Returns ------- item1_vector : array item1 GloVe vector item2_vector : array item2 GloVe vector cos_sim : float cosine similarity of item1 and item2 vectors Help on function use_vec in module get_glove_use: use_vec(item1, item2) get USE vectors and cosine similairty of the two items Parameters ---------- item1 : str, list any word to compare, put in string for more than one word item2 : str, list any word to compare, put in string for more than one word Returns ------- item1_vector : array item1 USE vector item2_vector : array item2 USE vector cos_sim : float cosine similarity of item1 and item2 vectors  Cosine Similarity Example Using the two functions above, and another function compare_word_vec (which basically uses the two functions), we can easily obtain cosine similarity of two words.\n# using the two functions above, we can get # GloVe and USE vectors and cosine similarity of two input words os.chdir(gloveDir) _, _, glove_sim = glove_vec('fish','bear') _, _, use_sim = use_vec('fish','bear') print('use cos: ' + str(use_sim)) print('glove cos: ' + str(glove_sim))  INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore 0.11964830574261577 0.5305143  # the two functions glove_vex and use_vec are use in compare_word_vec compare_word_vec('man','fish')  INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore use cos: 0.49838725 glove cos: 0.18601566881803455  Note: From the example above, USE and GloVe similarly identy fish to be somewhat equally similar to bear and man (but just in different scale/degree).\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s try comparing at multiple words or phrase level. We will use new functions and give in new inputs as strings.\nsentence1 = ['old', 'man', 'caught', 'fish'] sentence2 = ['bear', 'hunted', 'trout'] sentence3 = ['bear','eat','six','fish'] print('old man caught fish \u0026amp; bear hunted trout:') phrase_vec(sentence1, sentence2) print('old man caught fish \u0026amp; bear eat six fish:') phrase_vec(sentence1, sentence3) print('bear hunted trout \u0026amp; bear eat six fish:') phrase_vec(sentence2, sentence3)  old man caught fish \u0026amp; bear hunted trout: INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore glove sim: 0.36609688461789297 USE sim: 0.50494814 old man caught fish \u0026amp; bear eat six fish: INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore glove sim: 0.6818474640845398 USE sim: 0.5896743 bear hunted trout \u0026amp; bear eat six fish: INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore glove sim: 0.6082457470353315 USE sim: 0.72352856  Note: From the example above, we can see that USE and GloVe capture somewhat differently. We can see that bear hunted trout and bear eat six fish are the most similar to each other, whereas old man caught fish is also similar to the context of bear eating six fish.\nMore detailed analysis is required, but the example above shows great possibilities to exploring semantics.\nPlotting Similarity Matrix Now that we can compare similarity of words and sentences, we can plot a simple pairwise matrix, which basically compares how similar each word is to another in the given list. Fortunately, we already have a plot for doing it (using Seaborn).\nI will only use few words as demonstration, since it\u0026rsquo;s been slowing up my computer so much!\nplot_sim_matrix(['man', 'bear', 'fish', 'trout'])  INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore  Ending Note In the example above, we only used simple noun words. The stronger blue color, the more similar the two words are. Thus, the diagonal strip is deep blue (similarity of same two words is 1). You can see fish and trout are more similar to each other, than is man to trout.\nKeep in mind that you can feed in more words and sentences to create and visualize a larger matrix.\nWe looked at setting up USE locally, and creating embeddings from USE. The cloned project also has sample version of GloVe vectors. We use the vectors from the two models to extract vectors and compare similarity of two texts.\n","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"7a4f6295ae0d4e8a6165d80d69954fad","permalink":"https://jinjeon.me/post/vectorspace/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/vectorspace/","section":"post","summary":"From setting up TensorFlow to creating vectors and cosine similarity","tags":["python","machine-learning"],"title":"Universal Sentence Encoder and GloVe on Narrative Semantic Representation","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Note: This post is a ported version of Jupyter Notebook from my mne-eeg project: https://github.com/jeon11/mne-egi/blob/master/walkthrough_advanced.ipynb/walkthrough_basics.ipynb Advanced Processing In the previous walkthrough notebook, we got to manually inspect raw instance and do some cleaning based on annotations and creating evoked responses from time-locked events.\nIn this section, we run independent component analysis (ICA) on the epochs we had from the last notebook. We look in ICs to identify potentially bad components with eye related artifcats. Then, we implement autoreject (http://autoreject.github.io) which automatically attempts to find bad channels and interpolate those based on nearby channels. At the end, we plot the ERPs by channels that we are interested in looking and make comparison.\nNote that the plots below will be using print statements for demonstration purposes.\nimport mne import pandas as pd import numpy as np from matplotlib import pyplot as plt import Tkinter from autoreject import AutoReject from autoreject import get_rejection_threshold from mne.preprocessing import ICA  Loading epochs We imported all the necessary dependencies.

A representative example is the cocktail party effect, which is a phenomenon in which you are able to concentrate on the voice of the speaker you are conversing with regardless of the various background noise in a party. Using ICA helps seperate the different sources of mixed sound, under the assumption that the sound components are linear. This method works for EEG signal preprocessing because we assume that each electrode is independent from the others. To think of it easily, I consider ICA as decomposing the data into multiple layers, and by excluding bad ICs, we filter the data.\n# the function calculates optimal reject threshold for ICA reject = get_rejection_threshold(epochs_tlstS) print(reject)  Estimating rejection dictionary for eeg Estimating rejection dictionary for eog {'eeg': 0.0007759871430524497, 'eog': 5.903189072009943e-05}  Low-frequency slow drifts Because ICA is sensitive to low-frequency slow drifts, it is recommended that 1Hz highpass filter is applied. Since this was already done to our raw instance in the previous notebook, it can be skipped. You can double check as below, or apply the highpass filter if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already.\n# double check highpass filter print(epochs_tlstS.info['highpass']) # epochs_tlstS.info['highpass'] = 1  1.0  Fit ICA Now we will run ICA on our epoch data. For simplicity and time sake, we will limit the number of components to 20 with fastICA method, which is the generally used one. The number of ICs can be created up to as many electrodes (in this case 128 - bad channels). In ica1.fit, we use the recommended reject threshold from Autoreject.\nica = ICA(n_components=20, max_pca_components=None, n_pca_components=None, noise_cov=None, random_state=None, method='fastica', fit_params=None, max_iter=200, verbose=None) print('fitting ica...') ica.fit(epochs_tlstS, reject=reject)  fitting ica... /Users/Jin/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/scipy/linalg/basic.py:1321: RuntimeWarning: internal gelsd driver lwork query error, required iwork dimension not returned.

We can manually inspect for ICs with noise, or identify bad ICs that correlates with oscillations from eye-related channels.

Also, activities shown in the frontal region, especially near the eye area, would not be helpful in our analysis. Eye movements are characterized as having significantly split activities between left and right. Component above does seem containing eye blinks, we mark that component bad by ica.exclude and we can see that component has been added.\nWe can also manually inspect for other components using plot_components besides the ones that the builtin method suggested. You can see that the component speficied above being grayed out as a bad IC. The plot prioritizes showing ICs with large activations and polarity, which means that most of the bad ICs could be found in the early ICs.\nprint(ica.plot_components(inst=epochs_tlstS))  [\u0026lt;Figure size 540x504 with 20 Axes\u0026gt;]  When running the code on ipython as suggested in the previous notebook, the plot is actually interactive.

Also, componnent 5 has activation in the frontal region, and has polar activities between left and right, which could potentially be eye movements.

Then we create epochs and plot evoked responses.\nIn the advanced walkthrough: walkthrough_advanced.ipynb, we implement independent component analysis (ICA) and autoreject, which is an automated tool for fixing data, to see how the epochs are improved and compare the evoked responses by conditions.\nThe script requires at least two files: - the raw data (download from Google Drive ~500MB) - exported event text log from NetStation software\nRunning the script in command line When running the Python script from command line, MNE recommends using ipython via:\nipython —-pylab osx -i mne-egi-walkthrough.py  For Windows, instead of osx, you would be specifying qt.\nImporting Let\u0026rsquo;s begin by importing all the necessary modules.

The whole script basically requires two main files. 1. raw_fname: The raw instance of eeg data file in .raw format 2. ns_eventlog: Netstation\u0026rsquo;s event exports in text\nThe selection variable is later used to specify which channels to plot and compare. Note, the first item in the selection list, EB channel is a virtual channel created from bipolar referene.\n# specify sample subject data directory raw_fname = '/Users/Jin/Documents/MATLAB/research/mne-egi/data/sfv_eeg_011ts.raw' ns_eventlog = '/Users/Jin/Documents/MATLAB/research/mne-egi/data/sfv_eeg_011ts_nsevent' # specify sub-sample of channels to look in detail selection = ['EB','E11','E24','E124','E36','E104','E52','E62','E92']  Reading in raw file Raw eeg data can be read in with a simple line below. You can specify montage kind in strings. See https://martinos.org/mne/dev/generated/mne.channels.read_montage.html for available montages. We set preload=True because some of the preprocessing functions require raw file to be preloaded.\nOnce the raw file is loaded, typing raw and raw.info will show details about the raw instance.\nprint('reading raw file...') raw = mne.io.read_raw_egi(raw_fname, montage='GSN-HydroCel-128', preload=True) print('Done!')  reading raw file... \u0026lt;ipython-input-3-8bc42ae4bead\u0026gt;:2: RuntimeWarning: The following EEG sensors did not have a position specified in the selected montage: ['E129'].

The numbers can be played around with, but this filter range will potentially remove general noise from environment and slow drifting signals. Other suggestions for highpass is 0.1; for 40 Hz lowpass.\nAfter bandpass filter is applied, type raw.info to check how raw.filter made changes.\n# apply bandpass filter to raw file (highpass, lowpass) raw.filter(1,30) # see highpass \u0026amp; lowpass filter print('highpass filter: ' + str(raw.info['highpass'])) print('lowpass filter: ' + str(raw.info['lowpass']))  highpass filter: 1.0 lowpass filter: 30.0  Creating meta dataframe We will deviate a little from processing raw file, and construct a dataframe that can be later used for effectively creating epochs or querying information we just need. This part uses the custom built module (also experiment specific as each experiment will have different paradigms and event tags). The extract_nslog_event constructs necessary pandas dataframe from ns_eventlog text file which we specified earlier in #Setting-basic-variables.\ncreate_df returns five dataframes, in which nsdata is a list from simply csv-read file that is used to create task-specific pandas dataframes. For example, df_lst is the initial dataframe created that includes all practice, trials, and sentences tasks. The rest of dfs contain task specific data.\n# create pandas data frames for different tasks nsdata, df_lst, df_plst, df_tlst, df_slst = extract_nslog_event.create_df(ns_eventlog)  creating data frame from ns event log... dataframes created for subject 011 trials found: 800 sentences found: 200  From now on, for simplicity sake, we will only examine the actual trials task part in this walkthrough. We can focus on looking at the data structure of trials task. Since the dataframe is already created specifically for trials, what we really want now is the onset (sample numbers) of when the event occured and the condition of the stimuli that was presented.\n# show data frame structure of 2rd index print(df_tlst.iloc[2])  code tlst label lstS onset 99867 cond 4 indx 1 Name: 2, dtype: object  The label for trials task was either a last word start (lstS) or last word end (lstE). Since we are interested in the onset of the word, we will extract just the onsets using the custom code.\n# create onset-only data frame (event tag specifications) df_tlstS = extract_nslog_event.create_df_onset(df_tlst) # show total events of interest len(df_tlstS)  400  Finding impedance check periods and annotating Now that we have dataframes setup, we continue to clean up the raw data. Throughout the acquisition, we ran impedance checks to make sure that all electrodes were in good contact with the scalp and that good signal is being read in. During the impedance check, the waveforms peak in extreme amount and we want to make note of these periods, telling the mne functions to avoid and ignore such periods.\n# find impedance onsets imp_onset, imp_offset, imp_dur = extract_nslog_event.find_impedances(nsdata) # annotate on raw with 'bad' tags (params `reject_by_annotation` will search for 'bad' tags later) annot_imp = mne.Annotations(imp_onset, imp_dur, [\u0026quot;bad imp\u0026quot;] * len(imp_onset), orig_time=raw.info['meas_date']) raw.set_annotations(annot_imp)  finding impedance periods... found 4 impedance periods! \u0026lt;RawEGI | sfv_eeg_011ts.raw, n_channels x n_times : 136 x 989490 (4947.4 sec), ~1.00 GB, data loaded\u0026gt;  Marking bad channels We also want to make note of bad channels. We can manually inspect for bad channels by seeing the actual raw data. raw.plot will show the actual raw file with annotations from above marked as red segments. You can inspect for good/bad channels and manually click on bad channels to mark them bad. Once you manually inspected the channels, type raw.info['bads'] to see how it is updated.\nNote that the plot below is a static figure for example sake. Running the code in ipython will allow us to horizontally and vertically scroll through data. Clicking on a channel will mark that channel red and be considered red. You can see that we\u0026rsquo;ve ran four impedance checks throughout the session (1 task switch period, every 100th trials out fo 400).\n# block=True is useful because it will wait to whatever change you make in the raw file at the plot stage print(raw.plot(bad_color='red', block=True))  Figure(782.64x483.12)  If you already had a list of bad channels noted during the acquisition period, you can skip the above manual inspection and simply specify the bad channels with a line of code:\nraw.info['bads'] = ['E127', 'E107', 'E49', 'E48', 'E115', 'E113', 'E122', 'E121', 'E123', 'E108', 'E63', 'E1'] print(raw.info['bads'])  ['E127', 'E107', 'E49', 'E48', 'E115', 'E113', 'E122', 'E121', 'E123', 'E108', 'E63', 'E1']  Detecting and rejecting eye blinks We\u0026rsquo;ve so far applied generic/broad preprocessing steps, such as bandpass filters, marking chunks of bad segments, and marking bad channels. Now we will look at finding eye blinks in the raw and add more annotations to mark those samples bad.\nStep 1: Setting bipolar reference Because the cap we use do not have EOG-specific channels, we use the channels that are nearest to the eyes and consider those as our virtual eye channels. Thus, such method has the risk of the eye channels actually not having just the eye-related oscillations. This is done by setting the bipolar reference, which is basically the subtraction of two opposing channels (ie. the top and bottom of each eye for eye blinks; the left and right of the eyes for eye movements).\nHere, we use just the right side of the eye only to detect eye blinks. From the subtraction of channel E8 and E126, a virtual channel EB is created.\n# let's begin eye artifact detections print('Starting EOG artifact detection') raw = mne.set_bipolar_reference(raw, ['E8'],['E126'],['EB']) # specify this as the eye channel raw.set_channel_types({'EB': 'eog'}) # double check the changes # print(raw.info['chs'])  Starting EOG artifact detection  Step 2: Detecting eye blinks Now that we have a virtual eye channel to inspect, we can try to identify any eye blinks. Because the virtual eye channel that is created from subtraction of the channels, the waveform of EB channel will be generally flat. You can inspect this by raw.plot.\nEye blinks are generally characterized as two eye channels having sudden opposing peaks. So the methodology is to find a sudden peak within the flat EB line. We have the options of:\n finding eye blinks via mne built in function finding eye blinks via scipy peak finding method  Both results in similar eye blink detections because the methodology of finding local peaks. We will only use the mne built in function and comment out the custom built function that uses scipy. reject_by_annotation will ignore the bad segments marked as bad earlier. The threshold of 0.0001 can be played around with but it is a reasonable threshold set after having manually inspect the data. The events_eog will be an array with [sample number, 0, eventlabel in number]\nevents_eog = eog.find_eog_events(raw, reject_by_annotation=True, thresh=0.0001, verbose=None) # type `help(scipy_annotate_eyeblinks)` for detail # raw = scipy_annotate_eyeblinks(raw, 'EB', 100) print('number of eye blinks detected: ' + str(len(events_eog)))  number of eye blinks detected: 1720  events_eog above will give where the eye blinks occured in samples. We will convert the sample number to seconds so we can annotate on the raw file.\n# get just the sample numbers from the eog events eog_sampleN = [i[0] for i in events_eog] # convert to seconds for annotation-friendly purposes for i in range(0, len(eog_sampleN)): eog_sampleN[i] = eog_sampleN[i] / float(200) # set annotation annot_eog = mne.Annotations(eog_sampleN, [0.1] * len(eog_sampleN), [\u0026quot;bad eye\u0026quot;] * len(eog_sampleN), orig_time = raw.info['meas_date'])  # add this eye blink annotation to the previous annotation by simply adding new_annot = annot_imp + annot_eog raw.set_annotations(new_annot) print('new annotation set!')  new annotation set!  Now that new annotation is set, let\u0026rsquo;s see the changes made to the raw. Again we will just have a figure printed out here. You can see the bad channels marked red (like E1), and bunch of red bars that potentially mark spikes/eye blinks. Because the Times x-axis is so zoomed out, we see all parts being red, but as we see the plot above, that is actually not true. We see that \u0026lsquo;bad eye\u0026rsquo; is annotated for any potential peaks in the \u0026lsquo;EB\u0026rsquo; channel that is newly created from bipolar reference.\n# you can check that more red segments are marked on the raw file print(raw.plot(bad_color='red'))  Figure(782.64x483.12)  Setting rereference Now that bad channels are marked and we know which bad segments to avoid, we will set eeg reference (We want to avoid doing reference before the bad data are marked and rejected).\nprint('setting eeg reference...') raw.set_eeg_reference('average', projection=True)  setting eeg reference... \u0026lt;RawEGI | sfv_eeg_011ts.raw, n_channels x n_times : 135 x 989490 (4947.4 sec), ~1019.5 MB, data loaded\u0026gt;  Creating epochs Now that we have done some primary artifact detections, we can create a first look on how our epochs look.

A more interesting plot could be using plot_joint method. You can see that most of the channels in the frontal region are showing flat, insignificant patterns.

Different shadow shapes and patterns can be created by manipulating the shadow’s light source direction and intensity, the physical object’s distance and angle, and the texture of the surface in which the shadow is casted. These physical properties can be used by the operator to create creative patterns with the projected shadows. Some of these physical affordances include playing with the shadow’s movement, superposing different object’s shadows and scaling the shadow’s size by moving the physical object closer or further from the light source. As aesthetically pleasing with its unique black and white contrast, shadows are a fascinating form of media that can create different textures and details based on the skill of the user.\nShadow Play aims to enhance such a playful shadow experience to more advanced creative form of art by allowing users digitally manipulate their shadows. By adding new digital affordances Shadow Play, users can print and add layers of multiple shadows onto the screen, and invigorate them with animated effects and motions. With such various mix of augmented shadow effects, users can utilize their body as a tool for creating their own unique shadow artwork and animations.\nSee full paper Summary of interaction:\nInput/Output: Shadow Play requires ample activity space for interaction. The system recognizes the user within the activity space, and then displays the digitally augmented shadow onto the projected screen. Optimizing the interaction was one of our key concerns. With camera as an input device for users to communicate with Shadow Play, we wanted to depict the metaphor of users taking pictures and filming the creation. By selecting different features, such as snapshot, mirror, effects, and loop, users can create unique patterns and artwork. Interaction:\n1. Setting the environment: With the shoot feature, users can add layers of current shadows to the previous ones. Users can create static shadows, in which we refer to as background/environment of the artwork. 2. Adding in motion and effects: After the environment has been set, users can enliven the shadow by adding in animated motions and effects. The loop feature, mainly inspired by Instagram, records the motion of shadows and then is automatically looped. By adding in the fireball effect, Shadow Play recognizes the hand motion of reaching out, which then shoots out a fireball from the tip of the hand. 3. Advanced: Mirror and Patterns: The mirror feature allows users to create symmetrical images and animation. The mirror feature is especially useful for creating patterns and symmetrical image, such as butterfly. With the mix of these features, users can create shadow artwork in playful environment. Shadow Play resembles the thought process and planning of an actual painting. Just as an artist would plan ahead where certain objects would be placed within the space before making the strokes, Shadow Play users have to deliberately organize the angle and distance of their body in order to perfect the layers of shadow into a single object shape. Such deliberation allows for more playful and interactive activity. By having the augmented shadows displayed on the screen, there is a loop of feedback and manipulation as users constantly refer to the captured shadow to make adjustments accordingly.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1512864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512864000,"objectID":"f46be14934638585765b16715a31a0d7","permalink":"https://jinjeon.me/project-archives/shadowplay/","publishdate":"2017-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project-archives/shadowplay/","section":"project-archives","summary":"Shadow Play aims to enhance playful shadow experience to more advanced creative form of art by allowing users digitally manipulate their shadows.

Regardless of multiple features within a single object, object classification seems to occur seamlessly within our cognitive process. In this experiment, we test how we prioritize each feature within an object and how these features are weighted when we categorize a certain object. Test subjects were given novel shapes that each featured either size, color, or orientation, and had to determine whether the shape belongs to a category of a given prototypical shape. The preliminary result showed that color was the single most determining feature when categorizing an object, showing 72.6% of incorporation in all trials, while orientation was the least with 60.7%, but the differences were not statistically significant. We further went on to use logistic regression to analyze the result, which showed thresholds for identifying a novel object to be in a certain category. However, these thresholds for each feature was not significantly different. The experiment suggests that categorization is more of an elaborate and holistic process that combines different features when categorizing a novel object.\n","date":1494374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494374400,"objectID":"fca828c759df5853ec9108d04afd3cbe","permalink":"https://jinjeon.me/project-archives/featureprioritization/","publishdate":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project-archives/featureprioritization/","section":"project-archives","summary":"Object classification is essential to human learning as it helps us cope with various stimulus around the world.

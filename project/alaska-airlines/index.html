<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>To help Alaska Airlines flexibly adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and improve its upsell strategies, we conducted user research to understand users&rsquo; behaviors, values, and motivations at different stages of their flight travel experiences. We studied Alaska Airlines and five other major airlines operating in the US to conduct competitive analysis and pair insights from user experience benchmarking.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<ul>
<li>Presented four major recommendations to research managers, product and eCommerce teams.</li>
<li>Research findings matched with the ongoing internal research, suggesting its validity.</li>
<li>Provided new insights to improve users&rsquo; overall experiences by adapting to the pandemic world.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-question">Research Question</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><p style="font-size: 16pt"><mark><em>&ldquo;What are the motivations for upgrading throughout the booking and overall flight experience with Alaska and its competitors? Additionally, has the current pandemic affected this experience?&rdquo;</em></mark><br><br></p>

<h2 id="user-research">User Research</h2>

<p>Please note that below are <strong><em>summarized insights</em></strong> and <strong><em>challenges</em></strong> our team had during the user research process.</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-competitive-analysis">Preliminary &amp; Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br>
To first better understand the competitive landscape of the airline industries, we examined the websites of the six airlines to visualize the user flow of booking a flight.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Key/fun Fact:</strong><br>
Despite the industry standard of generalizing the classification of seat types into economy, business, and first class, we noticed that each airline had different ways of classifying, naming, and promoting the different fare classes. We searched for areas that could be confusing and be improved for the users.</p>














<figure>


  <a data-fancybox="" href="fareclass.svg" data-caption="Each airline had its own ways of classifying and naming the seats. Even though the perks that came along with each fare type were quite consistent throughout, low-cost airline, such as Southwest, had a uniquely different seating plan.">

    <b>Each airline had its own ways of classifying and naming the seats. Even though the perks that came along with each fare type were quite consistent throughout, low-cost airline, such as Southwest, had a uniquely different seating plan.</b>
  </figcaption>


</figure>


<h4 id="insights">Insights:</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Alaska Airlines</strong>&rsquo; fare types were straightforward and transparent. The seat names are in consistent ascending order: <br>i.e. saver → economy → premium → first class.</li>
<li>Fare types and their associated perks can become very unclear:<br>
e.g. <strong>JetBlue</strong>&rsquo;s first class name is &ldquo;Mint&rdquo; which has no association with Blue.<br>
e.g. <strong>SouthWest</strong>&rsquo;s distinction between basic economy and economy is vague.</li>
<li><strong>United</strong> had the most visually busy interface and complex fare types, leading to a poor booking experience.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="qualitative-interview">Qualitative Interview</h3>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br>
To understand users&rsquo;:
<ol>
  <li>General flight behavior</li>
  <li>Top values<br></li>
  <li>Pain points<br></li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>Methods:</strong><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Remote Qualitative Interview: </b><br>
We conducted a total of 30 interviews (5 participants from 6 different airlines) remotely over UserTesting.com and Zoom. We probed for their general flying behaviors and preferences, and narrowed down to their most recent flight experience (considering both pre-COVID &amp; post-COVID).</li>













<figure>


  <a data-fancybox="" href="demographics.svg" data-caption="We accounted for various factors, including age, gender, income range, and travel behaviors, during our interview to capture the holistic view of participants&rsquo; travel experiences.">
<img src="demographics.svg" alt="" width="full" ></a>


  
  
  <figcaption>
    <b>We accounted for various factors, including age, gender, income range, and travel behaviors, during our interview to capture the holistic view of participants&rsquo; travel experiences.</b>
  </figcaption>


</figure>
</p>

<p><li><b>Interactive Journey Maps:</b><br>
We incorporated an <strong>interactive journey map</strong> session in each interview to have participants walkthrough their most recent experience and capture their moment-to-moment emotions and actions.</li></p>

<p>To capture their moment-to-moment emotions and actions, we divided the entire flight experience into four phases:
<ol>
<li><strong>booking the flight ticket</strong> (e.g. web vs. mobile vs. phone)</li>
<li><strong>before 24 hours of travel</strong> (includes preparation and traveling to the airport)</li>
<li><strong>being at the airport</strong> (checking-in, luggage, security checks, and so on)</li>
<li><strong>in-flight</strong> (seat space, perks, food &amp; beverage, etc)</li>
<li><strong>arrival</strong> (post travel experience)</li>

<hr />

<h2 id="key-insights-results">Key Insights &amp; Results</h2>

<p>Please note that below are <strong><em>partial results</em></strong> due to NDA.</p>

<h3 id="personas-highlights">Personas/Highlights</h3>

<p>We developed three prototypical personas (<strong>we intentionally used the term &ldquo;highlight&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;persona&rdquo; because they were modeled after participants that stood out with clear preference of values and motivations</strong>). We introduced the demographic information, a hypothetical trip destination, quote from the interview, means used to book and upgrade the seat. We also identified top values, pain points, and motivations for upgrading a seat.</p>














<figure>


  <a data-fancybox="" href="persona1.svg" data-caption="This first type of personas is characterized by how upgrading a seat is mandatory due to his large body size. With his tall height and broad shoulders, upgrading a seat is a necessity.">

<h3 id="characterizing-the-travel-experience">Characterizing the Travel Experience</h3>

<p>We then devised step-by-step recommendations for each travel stage (NDA).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>Please note this part is NDA sensitive. Based on key insights and results we synthesized from the data, we came up with four major recommendations.













<figure>


  <a data-fancybox="" href="recommendations.svg" data-caption="Our high-level summaries of the four recommendations">
<img src="recommendations.svg" alt="" width="full" ></a>


  
  
  <figcaption>
    Our high-level summaries of the four recommendations
  </figcaption>


</figure>
</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Key/fun Fact:</strong><br>
<ol>
<li><strong>TRANSPARENCY MATTERS</strong>: it is a critical factor in the overall experience especially due to COVID. For example, users desire clear communication on what services and ancillaries to expect when flying during this pandemic era.</li>
  <li>metrics, such as <strong>time to complete a booking</strong>, are <strong>less important</strong> than <strong>transparency</strong></li>
<li>Transparency is important because it translates to expectations. When expectations are not met, the overall experience worsens. </li>
<li>Clear communication on what each seat upgrade entails can entice users. <br>e.g. <strong>&ldquo;upgrading a seat will get you a 7-inch wider leg room&rdquo;</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>Users don&rsquo;t mind receiving few more notifications</strong> for clarifying and communicating the travel information (especially if contains deals). </li>
</ol></p>

<h3 id="design-recommendations">Design Recommendations</h3>

<p>Based on the four recommendations, we additionally modified some of the website elements to convey more transparency.</p>

<h4 id="1-show-what-services-are-suspended">1. Show what services are suspended</h4>














<figure>


  <a data-fancybox="" href="design_rec1.svg" data-caption="Click to see in a large view/ We added a devoted section that clearly communicates what services are currently suspended especially due to COVID (e.g. in-flight food &amp; beverages).
